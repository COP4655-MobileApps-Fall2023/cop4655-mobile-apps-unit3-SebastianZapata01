# Project 3 - HW2 Part 2

Submitted by: Sebastian Zapata

HW 2 is an app that introduces networking with the Movie Database API to retrieve the data from the API key and the link. It has the same features as the previous project, but with the poster collection view and when you click on a poster, it brings you to the same detail view as the other tab.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Notes

One of the challenges was getting the API to work properly but I figured out the issues and it worked properly.
